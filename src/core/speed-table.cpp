 * @brief 加速値による実質速度修正倍率テーブル /
 * This table allows quick conversion from "speed" to "energy"
 * @date 2019/05/10
 * @author deskull
 * @details
 * The basic function WAS ((S>=110) ? (S-110) : (100 / (120-S)))
 * Note that table access is *much* quicker than computation.
 *
 * Note that the table has been changed at high speeds.  From
 * "Slow (-40)" to "Fast (+30)" is pretty much unchanged, but
 * at speeds above "Fast (+30)", one approaches an asymptotic
 * effective limit of 50 energy per turn.  This means that it
 * is relatively easy to reach "Fast (+30)" and get about 40
 * energy per turn, but then speed becomes very "expensive",
 * and you must get all the way to "Fast (+50)" to reach the
 * point of getting 45 energy per turn.  After that point,
 * furthur increases in speed are more or less pointless,
 * except to balance out heavy inventory.
 *
 * Note that currently the fastest monster is "Fast (+30)".
 *
 * It should be possible to lower the energy threshhold from
 * 100 units to 50 units, though this may interact badly with
 * the (compiled out) small random energy boost code.  It may
 * also tend to cause more "clumping" at high speeds.
