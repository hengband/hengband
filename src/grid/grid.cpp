 * which is memorized but out-of-sight.

 * as when an object is created in a grid, when a terrain feature
 * "changes" from "floor" to "non-floor", when any grid becomes
 * "illuminated" or "viewable", and when a "floor" grid becomes
 * "torch-lit".
 *
 * Note the relatively efficient use of this function by the various
 * "update_view()" and "update_lite()" calls, to allow objects and
 * terrain features to be memorized (and drawn) whenever they become
 * viewable or illuminated in any way, but not when they "maintain"

/*
 * Some comments on the grid flags.  -BEN-
 *
 *
 * One of the major bottlenecks in previous versions of Angband was in
 * the calculation of "line of sight" from the player to various grids,
 * such as monsters.  This was such a nasty bottleneck that a lot of
 * silly things were done to reduce the dependancy on "line of sight",
 * for example, you could not "see" any grids in a lit room until you
 * actually entered the room, and there were all kinds of bizarre grid
 * flags to enable this behavior.  This is also why the "call light"
 * spells always lit an entire room.
 *
 * The code below provides functions to calculate the "field of view"
 * for the player, which, once calculated, provides extremely fast
 * calculation of "line of sight from the player", and to calculate
 * the "field of torch lite", which, again, once calculated, provides
 * extremely fast calculation of "which grids are lit by the player's
 * lite source".  In addition to marking grids as "GRID_VIEW" and/or
 * "GRID_LITE", as appropriate, these functions maintain an array for
 * each of these two flags, each array containing the locations of all
 * of the grids marked with the appropriate flag, which can be used to
 * very quickly scan through all of the grids in a given set.
 *
 * To allow more "semantically valid" field of view semantics, whenever
 * the field of view (or the set of torch lit grids) changes, all of the
 * grids in the field of view (or the set of torch lit grids) are "drawn"
 * so that changes in the world will become apparent as soon as possible.
 * This has been optimized so that only grids which actually "change" are
 * redrawn, using the "temp" array and the "GRID_TEMP" flag to keep track
 * of the grids which are entering or leaving the relevent set of grids.
 *
 * These new methods are so efficient that the old nasty code was removed.
 *
 * Note that there is no reason to "update" the "viewable space" unless
 * the player "moves", or walls/doors are created/destroyed, and there
 * is no reason to "update" the "torch lit grids" unless the field of
 * view changes, or the "light radius" changes.  This means that when
 * the player is resting, or digging, or doing anything that does not
 * involve movement or changing the state of the dungeon, there is no
 * need to update the "view" or the "lite" regions, which is nice.
 *
 * Note that the calls to the nasty "los()" function have been reduced
 * to a bare minimum by the use of the new "field of view" calculations.
 *
 * I wouldn't be surprised if slight modifications to the "update_view()"
 * function would allow us to determine "reverse line-of-sight" as well
 * as "normal line-of-sight", which would allow monsters to use a more
 * "correct" calculation to determine if they can "see" the player.  For
 * now, monsters simply "cheat" somewhat and assume that if the player
 * has "line of sight" to the monster, then the monster can "pretend"
 * that it has "line of sight" to the player.
 *
 *
 * The "update_lite()" function maintains the "CAVE_LITE" flag for each
 * grid and maintains an array of all "CAVE_LITE" grids.
 *
 * This set of grids is the complete set of all grids which are lit by
 * the players light source, which allows the "player_can_see_bold()"
 * function to work very quickly.
 *
 * Note that every "CAVE_LITE" grid is also a "CAVE_VIEW" grid, and in
 * fact, the player (unless blind) can always "see" all grids which are
 * marked as "CAVE_LITE", unless they are "off screen".
 *
 *
 * The "update_view()" function maintains the "CAVE_VIEW" flag for each
 * grid and maintains an array of all "CAVE_VIEW" grids.
 *
 * This set of grids is the complete set of all grids within line of sight
 * of the player, allowing the "player_has_los_bold()" macro to work very
 * quickly.
 *
 *
 * The current "update_view()" algorithm uses the "CAVE_XTRA" flag as a
 * temporary internal flag to mark those grids which are not only in view,
 * but which are also "easily" in line of sight of the player.  This flag
 * is always cleared when we are done.
 *
 *
 * The current "update_lite()" and "update_view()" algorithms use the
 * "CAVE_TEMP" flag, and the array of grids which are marked as "CAVE_TEMP",
 * to keep track of which grids were previously marked as "CAVE_LITE" or
 * "CAVE_VIEW", which allows us to optimize the "screen updates".
 *
 * The "CAVE_TEMP" flag, and the array of "CAVE_TEMP" grids, is also used
 * for various other purposes, such as spreading lite or darkness during
 * "lite_room()" / "unlite_room()", and for calculating monster flow.
 *
 *
 * Any grid can be marked as "CAVE_GLOW" which means that the grid itself is
 * in some way permanently lit.  However, for the player to "see" anything
 * in the grid, as determined by "player_can_see()", the player must not be
 * blind, the grid must be marked as "CAVE_VIEW", and, in addition, "wall"
 * grids, even if marked as "perma lit", are only illuminated if they touch
 * a grid which is not a wall and is marked both "CAVE_GLOW" and "CAVE_VIEW".
 *
 *
 * To simplify various things, a grid may be marked as "CAVE_MARK", meaning
 * that even if the player cannot "see" the grid, he "knows" the terrain in
 * that grid.  This is used to "remember" walls/doors/stairs/floors when they
 * are "seen" or "detected", and also to "memorize" floors, after "wiz_lite()",
 * or when one of the "memorize floor grids" options induces memorization.
 *
 * Objects are "memorized" in a different way, using a special "marked" flag
 * on the object itself, which is set when an object is observed or detected.
 *
 *
 * A grid may be marked as "CAVE_ROOM" which means that it is part of a "room",
 * and should be illuminated by "lite room" and "darkness" spells.
 *
 *
 * A grid may be marked as "CAVE_ICKY" which means it is part of a "vault",
 * and should be unavailable for "teleportation" destinations.
 *
 *
 * The "view_perma_grids" allows the player to "memorize" every perma-lit grid
 * which is observed, and the "view_torch_grids" allows the player to memorize
 * every torch-lit grid.  The player will always memorize important walls,
 * doors, stairs, and other terrain features, as well as any "detected" grids.
 *
 * Note that the new "update_view()" method allows, among other things, a room
 * to be "partially" seen as the player approaches it, with a growing cone of
 * floor appearing as the player gets closer to the door.  Also, by not turning
 * on the "memorize perma-lit grids" option, the player will only "see" those
 * floor grids which are actually in line of sight.
 *
 * And my favorite "plus" is that you can now use a special option to draw the
 * "floors" in the "viewable region" brightly (actually, to draw the *other*
 * grids dimly), providing a "pretty" effect as the player runs around, and
 * to efficiently display the "torch lite" in a special color.
 *
 *
 * Some comments on the "update_view()" algorithm...
 *
 * The algorithm is very fast, since it spreads "obvious" grids very quickly,
 * and only has to call "los()" on the borderline cases.  The major axes/diags
 * even terminate early when they hit walls.  I need to find a quick way
 * to "terminate" the other scans.
 *
 * Note that in the worst case (a big empty area with say 5% scattered walls),
 * each of the 1500 or so nearby grids is checked once, most of them getting
 * an "instant" rating, and only a small portion requiring a call to "los()".
 *
 * The only time that the algorithm appears to be "noticeably" too slow is
 * when running, and this is usually only important in town, since the town
 * provides about the worst scenario possible, with large open regions and
 * a few scattered obstructions.  There is a special "efficiency" option to
 * allow the player to reduce his field of view in town, if needed.
 *
 * In the "best" case (say, a normal stretch of corridor), the algorithm
 * makes one check for each viewable grid, and makes no calls to "los()".
 * So running in corridors is very fast, and if a lot of monsters are
 * nearby, it is much faster than the old methods.
 *
 * Note that resting, most normal commands, and several forms of running,
 * plus all commands executed near large groups of monsters, are strictly
 * more efficient with "update_view()" that with the old "compute los() on
 * demand" method, primarily because once the "field of view" has been
 * calculated, it does not have to be recalculated until the player moves
 * (or a wall or door is created or destroyed).
 *
 * Note that we no longer have to do as many "los()" checks, since once the
 * "view" region has been built, very few things cause it to be "changed"
 * (player movement, and the opening/closing of doors, changes in wall status).
 * Note that door/wall changes are only relevant when the door/wall itself is
 * in the "view" region.
 *
 * The algorithm seems to only call "los()" from zero to ten times, usually
 * only when coming down a corridor into a room, or standing in a room, just
 * misaligned with a corridor.  So if, say, there are five "nearby" monsters,
 * we will be reducing the calls to "los()".
 *
 * I am thinking in terms of an algorithm that "walks" from the central point
 * out to the maximal "distance", at each point, determining the "view" code
 * (above).  For each grid not on a major axis or diagonal, the "view" code
 * depends on the "cave_los_bold()" and "view" of exactly two other grids
 * (the one along the nearest diagonal, and the one next to that one, see
 * "update_view_aux()"...).
 *
 * We "memorize" the viewable space array, so that at the cost of under 3000
 * bytes, we reduce the time taken by "forget_view()" to one assignment for
 * each grid actually in the "viewable space".  And for another 3000 bytes,
 * we prevent "erase + redraw" ineffiencies via the "seen" set.  These bytes
 * are also used by other routines, thus reducing the cost to almost nothing.
 *
 * A similar thing is done for "forget_lite()" in which case the savings are
 * much less, but save us from doing bizarre maintenance checking.
 *
 * In the worst "normal" case (in the middle of the town), the reachable space
 * actually reaches to more than half of the largest possible "circle" of view,
 * or about 800 grids, and in the worse case (in the middle of a dungeon level
 * where all the walls have been removed), the reachable space actually reaches
 * the theoretical maximum size of just under 1500 grids.
 *
 * Each grid G examines the "state" of two (?) other (adjacent) grids, G1 & G2.
 * If G1 is lite, G is lite.  Else if G2 is lite, G is half.  Else if G1 and G2
 * are both half, G is half.  Else G is dark.  It only takes 2 (or 4) bits to
 * "name" a grid, so (for MAX_RAD of 20) we could use 1600 bytes, and scan the
 * entire possible space (including initialization) in one step per grid.  If
 * we do the "clearing" as a separate step (and use an array of "view" grids),
 * then the clearing will take as many steps as grids that were viewed, and the
 * algorithm will be able to "stop" scanning at various points.
 * Oh, and outside of the "torch radius", only "lite" grids need to be scanned.
